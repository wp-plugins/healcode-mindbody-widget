Add HealCode Widgets, which display your MINDBODY information, to your WordPress website using shortcodes.



== Description ==

**Now developers and non-developers alike can add HealCode Widgets to WordPress websites using shortcodes!** 

This plugin lets you generate shortcodes for your HealCode Widgets. The shortcodes can be used in your pages, posts, and WordPress widgets to display your MINDBODY information.

HealCode syncs with your MINDBODY account and can display MINDBODY information including classes, enrollments, appointments, staff biographies, class/enrollment descriptions, and more.

**NOTE** You will need a HealCode account to use this plugin. Visit [HealCode](http://www.healcode.com/ "HealCode") to sign up! If you are a developer, you can learn more about our Developer Partner program [here](http://www.healcode.com/developer-signup/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are HealCode Widgets? =

HealCode widgets are installed onto your website and Facebook pages and sync with your MINDBODY account. They are also mobile-friendly.

[Sign up for HealCode!](http://www.healcode.com/sign-up/ "Sign up for HealCode!")

= How do I add a HealCode Widget ? =

See our [HealCode MINDBODY Widget Plugin FAQ](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203647654-Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-ORG-using-shortcodes-generated-by-a-plugin-Advanced-)

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/117301143]

= Where do I find my HealCode Widget code ? =

You can find the code for each Widget in each Widget's control panel in the HealCode Manager. You can login [here](https://manager.healcode.com/users/sign_in "here"). 

= What if I make changes to the Widget, will I need to reinstall the shortcode or copy the Widget code again ? =

No, you will only need to create the Widget shortcode once. The exceptions to this are if the shortcode is deleted from your WordPress Admin area or if you create a new website.

= My Widgets are already installed, do I need this plugin ? =

You do not **need** the plugin, but we recommend that you use it. The plugin makes it easier for you to manage pages on which Widgets are installed. 

Want to switch to the plugin? Install a Widget using the plugin on a test page before you delete anything, if you prefer the plugin, you will need to delete your previous Widgets from your website and replace them with the plugin shortcodes.

You can find instructions for installing a Widget with the plugin [here](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203647654-Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-ORG-using-shortcodes-generated-by-a-plugin-Advanced-).

= How are these Widgets different from my current HealCode Widgets ? =

These are exactly the same Widgets that you are currently using. They are just installed differently.

= Is there another way to install the Widgets to my WordPress website? =

Yes, see our FAQ [here](https://healcode.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202985730-Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-ORG).

= HealCode MINDOBDY Widget is not working properly. =

Please check the WordPress version you are using. Make sure it meets the minimum version recommended by us. Make sure all files of the `healcode_mindbody_widget` plugin are uploaded to the folder `wp-content/plugins/`

Also, if you have updated the Widget Title for any Widget shortcodes, you will need to re-add the shortcode to your page, post, or WordPress widget. This is because changing the Widget Title changes the shortcode itself.

= I have 2 HealCode Widgets placed adjacently, but only one of them works. =

Please use a whitespace to separate 2 shortcodes.
